# ML-Heart-disease-prediction

Description:
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques.  
The model is trained on a structured medical dataset containing patient health parameters and helps in early risk assessment.

This project was developed as part of task to understand data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset:
The dataset includes the following features:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise induced angina
- ST depression
- Slope of ST segment
- Number of major vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target (presence or absence of heart disease)

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier  
  Model selection and tuning were performed to improve performance

Project Workflow:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature selection
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
6. Model tuning and optimization
